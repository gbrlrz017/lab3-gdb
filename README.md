Learning to use gdb. Fixing bugs.


Fixed Known bugs:

The first thing printed by ls is always (null).

ls prints the text !!!WE ARE LEGION!!!

ls prints the text lolololololololololololololololololololololol

Running ls turns the terminal red.

Running ls prints the files separated by commas rather than the default behavior of printing a nice table.

The -a flag no longer prints the . and .. files as it is supposed to. (HINT: -a is behaving like -A.)

Running the command ls --help just prints the Anonymous logo mask and doesn't print any help information.

Running ls -R quotes a Monty Python insult at you.

Running ls -R segfaults.

Running ls -l segfaults.
